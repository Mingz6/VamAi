- [x] Task#1:
💻 Setup VSCode/Cursor & Create Your First Python Program

🎯 Goal:
Set up your programming environment and create your first Python program.

❓ Why:
Learning to set up a proper development environment is the first crucial step in coding. This will help you get comfortable with the tools that professional developers use daily.

🎬 Relevant Lecture Video:
Minute 3 to Minute 10 in this lecture recording

📝 Action Items:
⬇️ Download and install VSCode or Cursor from their official websites
🖥️ Open the application once installed
📄 Create a new file and save it as "hello_world.py"
🤖 Use the AI Assistant in Cursor (or GitHub Copilot in VSCode) to help you write a fancy "Hello, World!" program that includes your name, perhaps with colors, ASCII art, or animation
▶️ Run the program by clicking the play button or using the terminal command: python hello_world.py
📸 Take a screenshot showing your coding environment and the output
📋 Final Deliverable:
🖼️ Post your screenshot in the 📊｜week-3-outputs channel showing your code and the fancy "Hello World" message running successfully
✅ Type "yes" in the Google Sheets to indicate you've completed this task

- [x] Task#2:
🔄 Setup Github & Create Your First Web Page with GitHub Pages

🎯 Goal:
Set up GitHub and publish your first web page online.

❓ Why:
GitHub is the industry standard for code sharing and collaboration. Learning to deploy websites using GitHub Pages gives you a free and easy way to showcase your projects online.

🎬 Relevant Lecture Video:
Minute 11 to Minute 25 in this lecture recording

📝 Action Items:
👤 Create a GitHub account if you don't have one: https://github.com/signup
📁 Create a new repository (https://github.com/new) - give it a name related to your app idea
🖥️ Open VSCode/Cursor and create a simple index.html file
🔠 Write index.html file on Cursor/VSCode that contains your app concept (perhaps using an AI Assistant for help). You can view it locally by opening the file on your browser
⬆️ Upload your HTML file to your GitHub repository from Cursor's Terminal using one of these methods:
Option A: GitHub Desktop (Beginner-friendly)
Download and install GitHub Desktop
Clone your repository to your local machine
Add your files to the local repository folder
Commit your changes and push to GitHub
Option B: Git Command Line (Advanced)
Set up SSH for GitHub (recommended for security): GitHub SSH Setup Guide
Clone your repository: git clone git@github.com:yourusername/your-repo.git
Add your files to the repository folder
Stage changes: git add .
Commit changes: git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push to GitHub: git push origin main
🌐 Deploy your Site on Github (Note that you must have index.html in the root of your repository for this to work):
Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings (Settings → Pages → select main branch): GitHub Pages docs
Wait a few minutes for your site to deploy
Return to the GitHub Pages section (Settings → Pages) to find your live site URL (it will look like: https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo/ as shown in the image below)
GitHub Pages Settings Example
📋 Final Deliverable:
🔗 Share the live link (and a screenshot) to your GitHub Pages website in the 📊｜week-3-outputs channel (e.g., https://issamlaradji.github.io/my_app/)
✅ Type "yes" in the Google Sheets to indicate you've completed this task

- [x] Task#3:
🚀 Setup Huggingface Spaces & Create an Interactive App

🎯 Goal:
Build a simple proof-of-concept app with Gradio and deploy it on Hugging Face Spaces.

❓ Why:
Hugging Face is a powerful platform for AI applications. This exercise introduces you to creating interactive applications that others can use online without installing anything.

🎬 Relevant Lecture Video:
Minute 37 to Minute 48 in this lecture recording

📝 Action Items:
👤 Create a Hugging Face account if you don't have one: https://huggingface.co
📄 In VSCode/Cursor, create a new file called "main.py"
🤖 Use the AI Assistant to help you write a simple Gradio app for your AI idea (it could be a text classifier, image generator, or calculator) - Gradio docs
🧪 Test your app locally to make sure it works
🌐 Create a new Space on Hugging Face (select Gradio as the framework): https://huggingface.co/spaces
⬆️ Upload your main.py file and any necessary requirements (Hugging Face docs)
⏱️ Wait for your app to deploy and then view it on Hugging Face
📋 Final Deliverable:
🔗 Share the live link (and a screenshot) to your Hugging Face Space app in the 📊｜week-3-outputs channel (e.g., https://huggingface.co/spaces/issamlaradji/my_app)
✅ Type "yes" in the Google Sheets to indicate you've completed this task
