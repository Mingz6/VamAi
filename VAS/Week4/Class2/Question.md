How would you describe the appâ€™s value in just one sentence? (e.g. A tool that eliminates mindless doomscrolling with knowledge bites)
What kind of data will the AI app be dealing with? (e.g. emails, schedules, etc)
What should the AI app give back to the user? (e.g. an organized calendar)
If the app were a person, what would they need to be able to do to get the right results to the user? (e.g. read websites, summarize emails

Example:
How would you describe the app's value in one sentence?
 - This app gives clinic managers their valuable time back by handling all the schedule-juggling that comes with having patients cancel and reschedule their appointments.
What kinds of data will the AI app be dealing with?
 - Personal identification information (names, phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, birthdays, family members, preferred clinician), calendar information (Appointment dates, holidays, staff availability, office hours, patient availability)

What should the AI app give back to the user?
 - A scheduled calendar of appointments with patients assigned to a clinician, a waitlist of patients to contact in case of cancellation, and any notes which need to be communicated to the clinic staff from the patient regarding their appointment
If the app were a person, what would they need to be able to do to get the results to the user?
 - They would need to be able to send and receive emails and voice calls, discern patient intent, urgency, and act accordingly with empathy and understanding, and handle scheduling appointments as they are cancelled, rescheduled, and waitlisted. They would also need to be able to navigate the scheduling software to make sure no patient's appointments are slipping through the cracks, and that they are seen as close to the recommended time appropriate.
