## Answer:
I often struggle to remember the setup and configurations I implemented in the past, especially those from five years ago. To address this, I want to create an AI-powered bot that guides me through repository setup and configuration. The bot will analyze the repository's contents, allowing me to ask questions and receive answers based on the repo's code and documentation.

This AI bot will be highly beneficial to both me and my colleagues by providing:

- **Automated Setup Scripts** – I can ask the bot to generate a script for setting up the repository. Based on the repository's content (Markdown files and code), the bot will create a script to configure the required environment.
- **Environment Requirements** – I can inquire about the necessary environment setup, and the bot will provide a list of required dependencies along with installation scripts.
- **Repository Purpose** – When asked about the purpose of the repository, the bot will generate a summary based on its contents, such as "This repository hosts a web application for data visualization."
- **Content-Based Responses** – The bot will answer questions strictly based on the repository's content. If a piece of information is not included in the repository (e.g., the author's name), the bot will not provide an answer.

This tool will streamline repository onboarding, reduce setup time, and enhance collaboration by making it easier to understand and configure projects.
